      Hi my name Angel. I have been on this earth for a little over 30 years now. Throughout that time I have has many ups and downs, hobbies, and goals. I was born in Manhattan New York to two immigrant Dominican parents. Although Spanish was my first language growing up, since both parents were busy with work and or school; I grdually lost most of my spanish by watching a ton of american TV. This is one of my greatest regrets that I still struggle to undo to this day.

      I grew up a sick kid with all of my teachers having always told my parents that I was gifted. In 3rd grade I was finally given the chance to prove my teachers right and gain something from it. My third grade teacher Ms. Ray requested that I be given one of the few slots to test into a school for the giften in New york called Mott Hall. Mott Hall was a school like no other. Classes started at 9am and ended at 2:30pm. Chess and lego robotics were mandatory classes and I loved it. Lego robotics was actually my first introduction to coding. Once we put the mechanical Lego pieces together we had to code instuctions to the robot such as the input from the contorl, the motors and sensors and what the robot would do with that information.

      Leaving New York

      Being constantly sick made me miss a lot and was a starting factor to a terrible nearly lifelong depression. I had lived in both New York and New Jersey moving back and forth several times prior to entering Mott Hall. Having to leave Mott Hall after 5th grade becausee only new york residents could continue attending and my parents could no longer afford it, was one of the greatest detriments to my life. Moving to Jersey to start 6th grade was a huge blow to my development. For the next three years I was basically repeating information since Mott Hall was much further ahead in the curriculum. This change led to an increase in laziness and depression. 
      The depression continued to follow me into highschool and beyond into college. In highschool I passed classes on mainly tests doing as little homework as possible. I regret this as not applying myself built a terrible work ethic and foundation for college. 
      While in college, I was a bit too focused on others and neglected my studies and myself. A mistake that I continue to pay for to this day. I now work and am attending this course trying to rectify my past mistakes and be a better version of myself someone who didn't completely waste the intelligence and passion for learning they once had as a child.
